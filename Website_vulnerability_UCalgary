# Website Vulnerability Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in ethical hacking. I am currently studying in the 8th standard in Tamil Nadu, India.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across the **admin control panel** of your website. This panel appeared to contain sensitive information about your site. I am unsure if this data is real or accessible to unauthorized users, but I felt it was important to report it for your review.  

The affected page was:  
`http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~groupii/html/admin/admin.php`  

Unfortunately, this page no longer seems to be active, but I have attached screenshots of the panel for reference.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Use Google Dorks to search for sensitive pages (e.g., admin control panels).
2. Locate the URL mentioned above.
3. Access the page to view the admin control panel.

> Note: As of now, this page is not functional.

## Recommendation
Please review this report and assess the issue to ensure the security of your website. Kindly take necessary actions to secure sensitive areas and implement proper access controls.

## Screenshots
i will attach the pics in this 

## Request for Acknowledgment
I hope this report is helpful. If you find it valuable, I would appreciate acknowledgment or any feedback. Additionally, if your organization has a bounty program for reporting vulnerabilities, I request you to consider this report.

Thank you.  
**Navarath**
