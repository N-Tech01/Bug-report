# Ucalgary Website Vulnerability Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking in cadd centre. I am currently studying 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across the **admin control panel** of ucalgary website. This panel contain sensitive information about that site. I am unsure if this data is real or accessible to unauthorized users, so I report it to the official team. The official team responded me and they raised a ticket.  

The admin page was:  
`http://webapps2.ucalgary.ca/~groupii/html/admin/admin.php`  

Unfortunately, this page no longer seems to be active, but I have attached screenshots of the panel for your reference.

## Steps
Use Google Dorks to search for sensitive sites (e.g., admin control panels ).
